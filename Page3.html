      <br>
      <p>My first inspiration would be my Grandad. He was taught himself tennis while he was doing his post-graduate studies in the US and passed on his knowledge and skills to me, even through his 60s. This inspired me as he showed me that tennis can be picked up by almost anyone who is willing to put in the time and effort.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center" style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Roger Federer</b></h1>
      <br>
    <p>Growing up, I frequently watched tennis with my Grandad on TV and the player we would always keep an eye on would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer" target="_blank">Roger Federer</a>(link). He is my inspiration as he makes tennis look so easy. His movement on the court is fluid and graceful, almost like he's dancing. Off the court, he is gracious and understanding towards the media and his fans. </p>
    <p>I try to emulate his game by closing points fast and being as aggressive as I can in my shots. This is contrary to the current trend of playings defensively. Nevertheless, I am happy with my playstyle as it brings a certain excitement to the more monotonous defensive style of play.</p>

	<p>The above is just one of the many videos I watch of Federer; just look at his elegance when he's playing!</p>
